    "summary": "Designed a robust grading tool to simplify assessment workflows, support diverse evaluation styles, and streamline end-of-term reporting.",
    "overview": "This gradebook was one of the most complex and impactful tools I’ve worked on, built to support K–12 educators managing assignments, assessments, and end-of-term reporting. The goal was to create a grading system that felt intuitive for daily use while offering the flexibility needed to support diverse evaluation methods, school policies, and reporting requirements.\n\nI led the end-to-end UX process, conducting deep research with teachers and school administrators to understand grading workflows, pain points, and various edge cases. We facilitated interviews, screen shares, and prototype walkthroughs to validate everything from grading scheme preferences to exemption logic and reporting behaviour.\n\nThe final product supports points-based, percentage, level-based, and rubric grading. It allows teachers to handle late submissions, exemptions, overrides, weighted categories, and multiple reporting terms. The interface was optimized for speed and clarity, supporting keyboard-first entry, bulk actions, and quick navigation, while ensuring accuracy and auditability during high-pressure periods like report card season.",

    "title": "UX Integration into the SDLC",
    "summary": "Led a process initiative to integrate UX seamlessly into every stage of the SDLC, improving collaboration, reducing rework, and elevating product quality across teams.",
    "overview": "This initiative wasn’t about tweaking a screen or updating a flow — it was about changing how UX showed up in the product development process. As Lead UX Designer, I worked closely with my design team as well as PMs, engineers, and QA to take a hard look at how design was (or wasn’t) being integrated across the SDLC, to identify gaps in our process and opportunities for better integration.\n\nToo often, UX was brought in late, after key decisions had already been made. That meant we were solving the wrong problems, rushing through handoffs, or seeing avoidable issues pop up during development. To change that, I wanted to ensure we were embedding UX earlier — joining discovery meetings, helping shape ideas from the start, validating concepts with stakeholders and users before development, and staying involved through sprint planning, standups, and handoff reviews. I introduced a dedicated UX Jira board to track design work, priorities, and promote iterative feedback between teams.\n\nOne of the biggest wins was adding a UX QA step at the end of the process. This gave us a chance to make sure what got built matched what was designed, followed our design system, and felt consistent with the rest of the product.\n\nAll of this helped us reduce rework, ship better experiences, and build stronger relationships across teams. More importantly, it helped shift the perception of UX — from a support role to a strategic partner at the table from day one.\n\n",

    "summary": "Transformed a manual, error-prone quoting process into a scalable digital tool that empowers sales reps to quote preventative maintenance for entire fleets in minutes.",
    "overview": "I led the redesign and development of the Service Agreement Quoting (SAQ) application—a tool that enables heavy equipment dealers to quote preventative maintenance services for multiple machines at once. Before SAQ, sales reps relied on Excel to manually build one-off quotes per machine, leading to wasted time, pricing inconsistencies, and a high risk of human error.\n\nTo truly modernize this process, we conducted extensive UX research in close partnership with a key dealership customer. This involved shadowing sales reps, mapping out their quoting workflows, and identifying edge cases that surfaced during real quoting scenarios. We facilitated multiple working sessions to unpack the nuanced requirements of contract structures, machine-specific pricing logic, and dealer-specific business rules.\n\nThe resulting design was a web-based tool that supports bulk quoting with built-in logic for standard jobs, serial-specific parts and labor, and flexible pricing models. The redesign emphasized usability and trust—ensuring reps could quote complex fleets confidently while maintaining full visibility into quote breakdowns. By integrating with iQuote and CloudLink, the tool also aligned with broader dealer workflows and system architecture.",
