The feature uses AI-powered speech recognition to transcribe natural language into structured data, automatically syncing with backend systems via API. This eliminated the need for tedious manual entry, making it faster and easier for reps to capture important context while it's still fresh—whether walking out of a meeting or driving to the next one. The UX focused on simplicity, speed, and accessibility to ensure it supported real-world sales behavior without adding friction.",
